## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to incentivize academic excellence by providing students with a transparent and automated platform for tuition fee reimbursement. By leveraging blockchain technology, this smart contract eliminates manual inefficiencies and fosters trust.

## Key Features

1. **Fund Management**: Enables the owner to add reimbursement funds to the smart contract.
2. **Student Registration**: Allows the owner to register students with details about their tuition fees and academic grades.
3. **Eligibility Validation**: Automatically checks if students meet the minimum academic requirements for reimbursement (e.g., grades >= 75%).
4. **Claim Reimbursement**: Eligible students can claim their tuition reimbursement seamlessly.
5. **Transparency**: Provides a public record of student registrations, eligibility, and reimbursement claims.
6. **Security**: Funds are only disbursed to eligible students and cannot be tampered with.
